# IPv6 to IPv4 Script

This script allows you to run an IPv4 script or application on a system with IPv6 connectivity by utilizing an IPv6-to-IPv4 proxy. It prompts the user for the IPv4 proxy address and port, checks the availability of IPv4 connectivity, and then runs the IPv4 script using the specified proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Bash: The script is designed to run on a Bash shell.

- IPv6 Connectivity: The system executing the script should have IPv6 connectivity.

- `wget` utility: Ensure that `wget` is installed on your system to download the script from a URL.

## Usage

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash

wget https://github.com/brian404/ipv6_to_ipv4/raw/main/ipv6_to_ipv4.sh && chmod +x ipv6_to_ipv4.sh
